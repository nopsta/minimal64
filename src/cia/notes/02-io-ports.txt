I/O Ports (PRA, PRB, DDRA, DDRB)
--------------------------------

Each CIA chip has 2 8-bit ports, Port A and Port B. 
The pins on the CIA chips for these ports are referred to by PA0-7 and PB0-7.

Ports A and B each consists of an 8-bit Peripheral Data Register (PR) and and 8-bit Data Direction
Register (DDR). 
- If a bit in the DDR is set to the ONE, corresponding bit in the PR is an output
- If a DDR bit is set to ZERO, the corresponding PR bit is defined as input. 

On a READ, the PR reflects the information present on the actual port pins (PA0-7, PB0-7) for both input and output bits.

In addition to normal I/O operation, PB6 and PB7 also provide timer output functions (depends on Control Registers, see 03-interval-timers.txt).

CIA 1 I/O Ports: Read keyboard/joystick/paddles/lightpen
--------------------------------------------------------
PRA   Data Port A             $dc00
  read 
    bits 0-3: set to 0 if a joystick in port 2 direction has been pressed
    bit    4: set to 0 if joystick port 2 fire button is pushed
  write
    bits 0-7: select a column of the keyboard matrix
    bits 6-7: Paddle Selection 01 = port A, 10 = port b
PRB   Data Port B             $dc01
  read
    bits 0-7: bit will be 0 if a key is pressed in the corresponding row for the column selected with $dc00
    bits 0-3: set to 0 if a joystick in port 1 direction is pushed
    bit    4: set to 0 if joystick port 1 fire button is pushed
  write
    bit    6: timer a toggle/pulse output
    bit    7: timer b toggle/pulse output
DDRA  Data Direction Port A   $dc02
DDRB  Data Direction Port B   $dc03
