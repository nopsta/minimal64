---
The C64 has 2 x MOS 6526 Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) Chips: CIA 1, CIA 2

The CIA chips provide I/O and timing capabilities:

- 16 Individually programmable I/O lines (2 x 8-bit ports A and B), in the C64 the I/O lines are used to:
   - read I/O devices such as keyboard, joystick, paddles (CIA 1)
   - control the bank of memory the VIC can access (CIA 2)
   - communicate with serial bus devices such as disk drives (CIA 2)
   - communicate on the user port (CIA 2) (The Serial port pin of CIA1 and CIA2 are also connected to the user port)
see 02-io-ports.txt

- 8 or 16-Bit handshaking on read or write

- 2 independent, linkable 16-bit interval timers (Timer A and Timer B)
  - write only 16 bit latch (timer start value)
  - read only 16 bit counter
  - same two registers are used to write to latch/read from counter
  - timers are ticked on every cpu cycle
see 03-interval-timers.txt

- 24-hour (AM/PM) time of day (TOD) clock with programmable alarm
see 04-time-of-day.txt

- 8-Bit shift register for serial I/O
  - the byte in the shift register is shifted bitwise to/from the SP (serial port) pin with every positive slope on the CNT (Count) pin

CIA Interrupts
--------------

Each CIA can generate 5 sources of interrupts:

- underflow from TIMER A 
- underflow from TIMER B
- TOD ALARM
- Serial Port full/empty 
- /FLAG. 

CIA 1 IRQ pin is connected to the IRQ Line, CIA 2 IRQ pin is connected to the NMI line.

CIA Chip Pins
-------------

Vss	           Ground connection 0V
PA0 - PA7      I/O Port A Bits 0-7 
PB0 - PB7	     I/O-Port B Bits 0-7
/PC            Port Control - Handshake output, Low pulse after read/write on port B.
TOD            Time Of Day clock input, either 50Hz or 60Hz input.
Vcc            5VDC input
/IRQ           Interrupt Request, output to CPU's IRQ input
R/W            High-level = Read (Move data from CIA), Low-level = Write (Move data to CIA)
/CS            Chip Select - low level means active CIA.
/FLAG          Negative edge IRQ input, can be used as handshake for either parallel port.
/phi2          Processor Î¦2 clock, data transfers occur only on high signal level.
DB0 - DB7	     Data bus Bits 0 - 7
/RES           Reset input, low signal initiates CIA.
RS0 - RS3      Register Select - Used to interface internal registers with bidirectional ports.
SP             Serial Port - bidirectional, internal shift register converts CPU parallel data into serial data and vice-versa.
CNT            Count - Internal timers can count pulses to this input. Can be used for frequency dependent operations.
