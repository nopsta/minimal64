Interval Timers (Timer A, Timer B)
----------------------------------

Each interval timer consists of a 16-bit read-only Timer Counter and a 16-bit write-only Timer Latch. 
- Data written to the timer are latched in the Timer Latch 
- Data read from the timer are present contents of the Timer Counter


Timer Control Registers (CRA, CRB)
----------------------------------

Each timer has an associated control Register

Control Register A (CRA)
------------------------

bit 0:  START    1 = Start Timer A, 0 = Stop Timer A
                 This bit is automatically reset when underflow occurs during one-shot mode

bit 1:  PBON     PB On/Off
                 - A control bit allows the timer output to appear on a PORT B output line (PB6 for TIMER A and PB7 for TIMER B)
                 - This function overrides the DDRB control bit and forces the appropriate PB line to an output

bit 2:  OUTMODE  Toggle/Pulse 1 = toggle, 0 = pulse
                 - Selects the output applied to PORT B. 
                 - On every timer underflow the output can either toggle or generate a single positive pulse of one cycle duration. 
                 - The Toggle output is set high whenever the timer is started and is set low by /RES

bit 3:  RUNMODE  One-Shot/Continuous 1 = one-shot, 0 = continuous
                 - In one-shot mode, the timer will count down from latched value to zero, generate the interrupt, reload the latched value, then stop
                 - In continuous mode, the timer will count from latched value to zero, generate interrupt, reload the latched value and
                   repeat the procedure continuously.

bit 4:  LOAD     1 = Force Load
                 - A strobe bit (not stored, cant be read back)
                 - allows the timer latch to be loaded into the timer counter at any time, whether the timer is running of not.

bit 5:  INMODE   1 = Timer A counts positive external pulses applied to CNT pin CNT Transitions
                 0 = Timer A counts phi2 clock pulses

bit 6:  SPMODE   1 = SERIAL PORT output (CNT sources shift clock)
                 0 = SERIAL PORT input (external shift clock required).

bit 7:  TODIN    1 = 50Hz clock required on TOD pin for accurate time.
                 0 = 60Hz clock required on TOD pin for accurate time

Control Register A (CRB)
------------------------

bit 0:  START    1 = Start Timer B, 0 = Stop Timer B
                 This bit is automatically reset when underflow occurs during one-shot mode

bit 1:  PBON     PB On/Off
                 - A control bit allows the timer output to appear on a PORT B output line (PB7 for TIMER B)
                 - This function overrides the DDRB control bit and forces the appropriate PB line to an output

bit 2:  OUTMODE  Toggle/Pulse 1 = toggle, 0 = pulse
                 - Selects the output applied to PORT B. 
                 - On every timer underflow the output can either toggle or generate a single positive pulse of one cycle duration. 
                 - The Toggle output is set high whenever the timer is started and is set low by /RES

bit 3:  RUNMODE  One-Shot/Continuous 1 = one-shot, 0 = continuous
                 - In one-shot mode, the timer will count down from latched value to zero, generate the interrupt, reload the latched value, then stop
                 - In continuous mode, the timer will count from latched value to zero, generate interrupt, reload the latched value and
                   repeat the procedure continuously.

bit 4:  LOAD     1 = Force Load
                 - A strobe bit (not stored, cant be read back)
                 - allows the timer latch to be loaded into the timer counter at any time, whether the timer is running of not.

bit 5,6:INMODE   00 = Timer B counts phi2 pulses
                 01 = Timer B counts positive CNT transitions.
                 10 = Timer B counts TIMER A underflow pulses.
                 11 = Timer B counts TIMER A underflow pulses while CNT is high.

bit 7:  ALARM    1 = writing to TOD registers sets ALARM
                 0 = writing to TOD registers sets TOD clock


The timer latch is loaded into the timer on any timer underflow, on a force load or following a write
to the high byte of the prescaler while the timer is stopped. If the timer is running, a write to the high
byte will load the timer latch, but not reload the counter.
