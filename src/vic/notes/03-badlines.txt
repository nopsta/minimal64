Bad lines
---------
Usually VICII accesses the data bus in the first clock phase and the CPU accesses the data bus in the second clock phase.

Typically the VIC will read the Video Matrix and Color RAM every 8 lines (see graphics-modes.txt for more on the Video Matrix and Color RAM). 
It will read Character Data every line.

1 clock phase isn't enough time for the VIC to access both the Video Matrix/Color RAM and the Character Generator data,
so the VIC will "stun" the CPU for 40-43 cycles on raster lines where it needs to access the Video Matrix/Color RAM.

It is called a "bad line" when the VIC stuns the CPU to read the Video Matrix/Color RAM

A formal definition of a bad line condition involves the value of YSCROLL and the cycle position in the raster line:

 A Bad Line Condition is given at any arbitrary clock cycle, if at the
 negative edge of Ã¸0 at the beginning of the cycle RASTER >= $30 (48) and RASTER
 <= $f7 (247) and the lower three bits of RASTER are equal to YSCROLL and if the
 DEN bit was set during an arbitrary cycle of raster line $30.
