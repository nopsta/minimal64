In the character display mode, the VIC fetches CHARACTER POINTERS from the VIDEO MATRIX area of memory and translates the pointers to
character dot addresses in the 2,048 byte CHARACTER BASE area of memory. The video matrix is comprised of 1,000 consecutive
locations in memory which each contain an eight bit character pointer. The location of the video matrix within memory is defined 
by bits VM13-VM10 in register 24 ($18) which are used as the 4 MSB of the video matrix address. The lower order 10 bits are provided
by an internal couiter (VC9-VC0) which steps through the 1000 character locations. 


The eight bit character pointer permits 256 different .character definitions to be available simultaneously. Each character is an
8x8 matrix of dots stored in the character base as eight consecutive bytes. The location of the character base is defined by bits
CB13-CB11 in register 24 ($18) which are used for the 3 most significant bits (MSB) of the character base address. The 11 lower
order addresses are formed by the 8 bit character pointer from the video matrix (D7-D0) which selects a particluar character, and a 3
bit raster counter (RC2-RC0) which selects one of the eight character bytes. The resulting characters are formated as 25 rows
of 40 characters each. In addition to the 8 bit character pointer, a 4-bit COLOR NYBBLE is associated with each video matrix location
(the video matrix memory is 12 bits wide) which selects one of sixteen colors for each character.
