Graphics Modes
--------------

The Graphics Mode is determined by bits 5 (BMM) and 6 (ECM) of vicii register 0xd011 and bit 4 (MCM) of register 0xd016

0xd011 VICII Control register 1
-------------------------------
bit 0: Vertical Scroll
bit 1: Vertical Scroll
bit 2: Vertical Scroll
bit 3: Row Select (RSEL)
bit 4: Display Enable (DEN)
bit 5: Bitmap Mode (BMM)
bit 6: Extended Color Mode (ECM)
bit 7: Raster Bit 8

0xd016 VICII Control Register 2
-------------------------------
bit 0: Horizonal Scroll
bit 1: Horizonal Scroll
bit 2: Horizonal Scroll
bit 3: Column Select (CSEL)
bit 4: Multicolor Mode (MCM)
bit 5: RES - not used
bit 6: - not used
bit 7: - not used


ECM  BMM  MCM  Mode
----------------------------------------
  0    0    0  Standard Character Mode
  0    0    1  Multicolor Character Mode
  0    1    0  Standard Bitmap Mode
  0    1    1  Multicolor Bitmap Mode
  1    0    0  Extended Background Color Mode
  1    0    1  Invalid Mode
  1    1    0  Invalid Mode
  1    1    1  Invalid Mode


Video Matrix and Color RAM
--------------------------

The Video Matrix and Color RAM are used by all Graphics Modes

Video Matrix (Screen RAM) 1000 (40x25) bytes in row-major order. Each byte represents a cell in the 40x25 grid 
The Video Matrix exists in System RAM and can be relocated
The Location of the Video Matrix is determined by the bits 4-7 of the VICII Memory Setup Register ($d018) and the location of the VICII Bank set in bits 0 and 1 of CIA 2 Register $dd00

Color RAM 1000 bytes in row-major order. Only bits 0-3 of each byte is used
Color RAM is always at the address ($d800-$dbff)

Standard Character Mode
-----------------------
40 or 38 columns of characters (determined by CSEL bit of $d016)
25 or 24 rows of characters (determined by RSEL bit of $d011)
Each Character is 8x8 pixels
One background color defined in VICII Register $d021
One Foreground Color Per Character defined in Color RAM ($d800-$dbff). One byte per character, high nibble is unused
1000 (40x25) byte Video Matrix determines which character in each location

Multicolor Character Mode
-------------------------
40 or 38 columns of characters (determined by CSEL bit of $d016)
25 or 24 rows of characters (determined by RSEL bit of $d011)
Foreground Color Per Character defined in Color RAM ($d800-$dbff).
If the Foreground Color is < 8, the character will be displayed as in Standard Character Mode
If the Foreground Color is > 7, the character will be displayed in Multicolor Mode:

  4x8 pixels per character, pixels are 'double-width' where each pixel color is defined by 2 bits:

  00 - background color from $d021
  01 - the color set in VIC Register $d022
  10 - the color set in VIC Register $d023
  11 - the color defined in color RAM ($d800-$dbff) for the character's locattion

The Location of the Video Matrix is determined by the bits 4-7 of the VICII Memory Setup Register ($d018) and the location of the VICII Bank set in bits 0 and 1 of CIA 2 Register $dd00

Standard Bitmap Mode
--------------------
320x200 bitmap, each 8x8 square can have 1 foreground and 1 background color
8KB (300x200 kilobits) of bitmap data, pointer to bitmap memory is set in bit 3 of VIC Memory Setup Register $d018
Color data comes from the 1000 (40x25) byte video matrix:
  bits 0-3 define the background color
  bits 4-7 define the foreground color
for the corresponding 8x8 square

Multicolor Bitmap Mode
----------------------
160x200 bitmap
As per Standard Bitmap Mode except pixels are double width, the color used for each pixel is determined by 2 bits from the bitmap

  00 - background color from $d021
  01 - use bits 4-7 from the corresponding position in the video matrix
  10 - use bits 0-3 from the corresponding position in the video matrix 
  11 - use bits 0-3 from the corresponding position in color ram

Extended Background Color Mode
------------------------------
Standard Character Mode
-----------------------
40 or 38 columns of characters (determined by CSEL bit of $d016)
25 or 24 rows of characters (determined by RSEL bit of $d011)
Each Character is 8x8 pixels
One Foreground Color Per Character defined in Color RAM ($d800-$dbff). One byte per character, high nibble is unused
bits 0-6 of 1000 (40x25) byte Video Matrix determines which character in each location (64 possible characters)
One of four background colors determined by the upper 2 bits of the corresponding location in the Video Matrix

bits 7-8 of a byte in video matrix:

  00 - background color is in $d011
  01 - background color is in $d012
  02 - background color is in $d013
  03 - background color is in $d014
