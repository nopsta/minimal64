Programmable Logic Array (PLA)
------------------------------

The PLA is responsible for dictating the memory map of the C64 and enables the implementation of bank switching.

The C64 has 64KB RAM, 8KB Kernal ROM, 8KB BASIC ROM, 4KB Character ROM, 4KB of I/O Registers as well as an expansion/cartridge port.

The MOS 6510 can access 65536 Memory Locations ($0000-$ffff). 

The PLA is responsible for mapping banks of the 64KB RAM, 20KB ROM, I/O Registers and expansion/cartridge port onto the 64KB addressable by the CPU.

The PLA is connected to the CPU control lines and the expansion port which, together, dictate which areas of memory are banked.
