Accumulator
-----------

Each clock cycle produces a new N-bit output consisting of the previous output obtained from the register summed with the 
frequency control word (FCW) which is constant for a given output frequency.

As I recall, the Oscillator is a 24-bit phase-accumulating design of which the lower 16-bits are programmable for pitch control. 
The output of the accumulator goes directly to a D/A converter through a waveform selector. 
Normally, the output of a phase-accumulating oscillator would be used as an address into memory which contained a wavetable, 
but SID had to be entirely self-contained and there was no room at all for a wavetable on the chip.

The Sawtooth waveform was created by sending the upper 12-bits of the accumulator to the 12-bit Waveform D/A.

The Triangle waveform was created by using the MSB of the accumulator to invert the remaining upper 11 accumulator bits using EXOR gates. 
These 11 bits were then left-shifted (throwing away the MSB) and sent to the Waveform D/A (so the resolution of the triangle waveform was 
half that of the sawtooth, but the amplitude and frequency were the same).

The Pulse waveform was created by sending the upper 12-bits of the accumulator to a 12-bit digital comparator. 
The output of the comparator was either a one or a zero. This single output was then sent to all 12 bits of the Waveform D/A.

The Noise waveform was created using a 23-bit pseudo-random sequence generator (i.e., a shift register with specific outputs fed back to
the input through combinatorial logic).The shift register was clocked by one of the intermediate bits of the accumulator to keep the 
frequency content of the noise waveform relatively the same as the pitched waveforms. The upper 12-bits of the shift register were sent 
to the Waveform D/A.
