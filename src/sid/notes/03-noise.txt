The noise generator is implemented as a 23-bit-length Fibonacci LFSR 
(Feedback polynomial: x^22+x^17+1).[10][11] 

When using noise waveform simultaneously with any other waveform, the pull-down via waveform selector tends to quickly reduce the XOR shift register to 0 for all bits that are connected to the output DAC. As the zeroes shift in the register when the noise is clocked, and no 1-bits are produced to replace them, a situation can arise where the XOR shift register becomes fully zeroed. Luckily, the situation can be remedied by using the waveform control test bit, which in that condition injects one 1-bit into the XOR shift register. Some musicians are also known to use noise's combined waveforms and test bit to construct unusual sounds.

The noise waveform is generated taking the output of eight selected bits from a 23 bit Fibonacci LFSR. 
There are actually 24 bits on chip but the last one is unused. 

The register is clocked when bit 19 of the oscillator goes high and has taps at bits 17 and 22. 

The register can be "reset" using the test bit: the c1 gate stays open and the output inverters slowly settle high.

The output from bits 0, 2, 5, 9, 11, 14, 18 and 20 is sent to the waveform selector.
